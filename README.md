Templates based on Zerb's Foundation

Feel free to help contribute layouts or themes. We are trying to collect generic layouts and then built custom themes off layouts. We figure with enough developers we'll be able to create a good starting point for any website or project. 

Information
====================

The *templates/* folder has basic generic layouts and templates to build off of. Use '_start.html' to begin a new layout.

*Themes/* folder has prebuilt themes. Place your theme inside its own folder. Each theme has prebuilt layouts and css to extend or over right foundation defaults.
